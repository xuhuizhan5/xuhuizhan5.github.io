Xuhui Zhan, a first-year Master's student in Data Science at Vanderbilt University and a professional research assistant there, embarked on his data science journey during undergraduate studies. This early foundation set the stage for his professional and academic growth.

Formerly an algorithm engineer, Xuhui specialized in automating AGV robots and developing machine learning systems for cargo data. This role deepened his practical insights into data science applications.

In his current academic pursuit, Xuhui focuses on deep learning areas like computer vision, NLP, and generative AI. His passion lies in creating machines that can understand the world and perform complex, multi-modal tasks. His ultimate goal is ambitious: to enable machines to dream, emulating one of humanity's most profound abilities.

Driven by the principle that “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic,” Xuhui aims to transcend the boundaries of technology, merging the real with the fantastical. He seeks to deepen his data science expertise, contributing to innovations that turn today’s science fiction into tomorrow's reality.
